#  First, the effect display 

In this section, add a planar segmentation module to QT 

#  II. Core Code 

The planar division in PCL is as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
#  III. QT Settings 

1. UI settings, determine the number of transmission parameters according to the core code, and set the layout according to your own preferences. 2. Add the menu bar action yourself to realize the connection with connect. The segmentation function is implemented in the slot function. The slot function code is as follows:

 1) Set the relevant plane equation in the parameters as follows:  

2) The next section implements cylindrical segmentation.

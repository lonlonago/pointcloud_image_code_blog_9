 In this section, the circular segmentation of point clouds in PCL is realized. The specific effects are as follows.  

#  II. Core Code 

The core code of circular segmentation in PCL is as follows:

 ```  
#  III. QT Settings 

1. UI settings. According to the core code, set the number of parameters that need to be passed to carry out ui layout. 2. Since there are few circular segmentation codes, it is not added to the pcl_function, but directly added to the relevant slot functions in the mainwindow. Remember to add relevant header files, actions in the menu bar, etc. The implementation of slot functions is mainly as follows:

 The desired result can be displayed in the parameter section, such as radius, circular equation, etc. As follows: The next section implements point cloud cylinder segmentation.

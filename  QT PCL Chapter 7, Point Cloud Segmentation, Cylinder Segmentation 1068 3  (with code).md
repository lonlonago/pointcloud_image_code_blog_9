 In this section, add a cylindrical split section to the QT, with the following effect:  

#  II. Core Code 

The cylindrical segmentation code in PCL is as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
#  III. QT Settings 

1. UI settings, according to the number of parameters required to pass the core code, the parameters are passed, and the layout is set by itself. You can refer to the filtering sections. 2. The segmentation code is implemented in the slot function, and it is necessary to add action to connect with the slot function. The slot function code is as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
Qmake, build it, you can achieve cylindrical segmentation.

 1. The point cloud cylindrical equation or the core parameters can be displayed in the parameter section, as follows: 2. The next section implements Euclidean clustering.
